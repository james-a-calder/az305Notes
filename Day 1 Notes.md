### Objectives
![Objectives](Screenshots/Day1/Gov1.PNG)

### Govern resources in Azure
Governance provides mechanisms and processes to maintain control over your applications and resources in Azure
![Govern resources](Screenshots/Day1/Gov2.PNG)

[Azure Management Areas ðŸ“Ž](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/azure-management)

![Areas of management that require maintaining](Screenshots/Day1/Gov3.PNG)

### Plan your management groups
Management groups manage access, Policy and compliance subscriptions

- Keep the management group hierarchy reasonably flat
- Consider a top-level management group
- Consider an organisational or departmental structure
- Consider a geographical structure
- Consider a production management group
- Consider a sandbox management group
- Consider isolating sensitive information in a separate management group

![Plan your management groups](Screenshots/Day1/Gov4.PNG)

**You can have 6 levels in your hierarchy (7 if you include the top Tenant root management group which can not be changed)**

**You have to explicitly add/elevate a Global Administrators access to be able to see other management groups.**

[Elevate access to manage all Azure subscriptions and management groups ðŸ“Ž](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin?tabs=azure-portal)

### Design for multiple subscriptions
Azure subscriptions are logical containers for management and billing.
- Align you subscriptions with the business needs and priorities - consider billing and cost reporting
- Consider administrative management - centralised or decentralised
- Group subscriptions together under management groups - apply common policies and role assignments.
- Consider subscription scale limits - specialised workloads, UoT, SAP
- Consider a dedicated shared services subscription - common services everyone shares
- make subscription owners aware of their riles and responsibilities

[Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints ðŸ“Ž](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits)

### When to use subscriptions - example
- Secure workloads that require additional policies and role-based access control to achieve compliance.
- Specialised workloads and the need to scale outside the subscription limits.
- Manage and track costs for your organisational structure.
- Identify different environments such as development, test and production that are isolated from a management perspective.

![When to use subscriptions](Screenshots/Day1/Gov6.PNG)

### Plan your resource groups
A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
- Group resources that share the same lifecycle
- Group by type, app, department, location, or billing
- Apply RBAC and policies to a group of resources
  - Control Plane
  - Data Plane
- Use resource locks to protect individual resources from deletion or change
  - Lock Types:
    - Delete Locks
    - Readonly Locks
  - Locks are inherited

![Plan your resource groups](Screenshots/Day1/Gov7.PNG)

**You are not able to change the name of resources or resource groups once they have been created.**

### Plan your Resource Tagging
- Consider your organisation's taxonomy
- Determine the reason for the tagging
  - Functional
  - Classification
  - Accounting
  - Partnership
  - Purpose
- Start with a few tags (mission critical resources) and then scale out
- Policies could be used to apply tags and enforce tagging rues and conventions - mimic inheritance

[Develop your naming and tagging strategy for Azure resources ðŸ“Ž](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging)

![Plan Your Tagging](Screenshots/Day1/Gov8.PNG)

### When To Use Azure Policy
Azure policy helps enforce organisational standards and to assess compliance at scale.
- Latge number of built in policies
- Examples
  - Allow only certain virtual machine sizes
  - Ensure all resources are correctly tagged - if not apply the tag
  - Recommended system updates on your servers
  - Enable multifactor authentication for all subscription accounts
  - etc...

![When To Use Azure Policy](Screenshots/Day1/Gov9.PNG)

### Consideration for Azure Policy
- Apply policy at the highest scope possible
- Know when policies are evaluated
- Decide what to do if a resource is non-compliant
- Consider when to automatically remediate non-compliant resources
- Use the Azure policy compliance dashboard fir auditing and review
- Effectively combine Azure policy with RBAC

![Consideration for Azure Policy](Screenshots/Day1/Gov10.PNG)

[Remediate non-compliant resources with Azure Policy ðŸ“Ž](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/how-to/remediate-resources?tabs=azure-portal)

### Design for Azure Role-Base Access Control (RBAC)
Azure RBAC allows you to grant access to Azure resources that you control
- Only grant users the access they need
- Assign at the highest scope level that meets the requirements
- Assign to roles to groups, not users
- Know when to create custom role
- Consider what happens if you have overlapping role assignments

![Design for Azure Role-Base Access Control (RBAC)](Screenshots/Day1/Gov11.PNG)

### When to combine Azure Policy and Azure RBAC

[What is an Azure landing zone? ðŸ“Ž](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/)

### Design with Azure Blueprints
Azure Blueprints lets you define a repeatable set of governance tools and standard Azure resources that your organisation requires. Blueprint is a form of orchestration.

![Implement Landing Zones](Screenshots/Day1/Gov14.PNG)

> If you delete a blueprint the resources created by it will remain.

#### *Azure Blueprints are being deprecated in favour of Template Specs and Deployment Stacks*
This is down to complications in versioning, redeployment and it also doesn't support bicep files.

##### Azure Deployment Stacks

An **Azure Deployment Stack** is a resource that allows you to manage a group of Azure resources as a single, cohesive unit. When you submit a Bicep file or an ARM JSON template to a deployment stack, it defines the resources that the stack manages.

###### Key Features:
- **Unified Management**: Manage multiple resources together as one unit.
- **Prevent Unwanted Changes**: Use deny settings to block undesired modifications.
- **Efficient Cleanup**: Easily remove resources with delete flags during updates.
- **Template Support**: Use Bicep, ARM templates, or Template specs for deployment.

###### Use Cases:
- **Provisioning Environments**: Create and manage test environments with multiple resources.
- **Resource Lifecycle Management**: Handle creation, updates, and deletion of resources efficiently.

###### More Than Just a Library of Bicep Files:
A deployment stack is more than just a library of Bicep files or ARM templates. It represents a cohesive unit that manages a set of resources defined by these templates.

- **Resource Management**: Deploy, update, and delete a group of Azure resources as a single unit.
- **State Maintenance**: The stack keeps track of the state of your resources, ensuring that changes are applied consistently.
- **Resource Grouping**: Logically group resources for better organization.
- **Deny Settings and Cleanup**: Set deny rules to prevent unauthorized changes and use delete flags for efficient resource cleanup.

So, while Bicep files or ARM templates are used to define the resources, the deployment stack is the mechanism that manages these resources as a unified entity.

##### Azure Template Specs

**Azure Template Specs** are a resource type within Azure Resource Manager (ARM) that allows you to store an ARM template or bicep file for later deployment.

###### Key Features:
- **Centralized Storage**: Store ARM templates in a central location within Azure, making them easily accessible.
- **Versioning**: Manage different versions of your ARM templates, allowing for consistent deployments and rollbacks.
- **Access Control**: Use Azure role-based access control (RBAC) to define who can access and deploy the templates.
- **Reusable Infrastructure Code**: Create a library of reusable infrastructure code that can be deployed consistently across different environments.
- **Deployment**: Deploy template specs using Azure tools like PowerShell, Azure CLI, the Azure portal, REST APIs, and supported SDKs and clients.

###### Benefits:
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistent deployments across various environments by using the same templates.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitate collaboration among teams by sharing template specs and managing access.
- **Efficiency**: Save time by reusing tested and approved ARM templates for different projects.

###### Example Workflow:
1. **Create Template Specs**: Author your ARM templates and store them as template specs in Azure.
2. **Version Management**: Use versioning to keep track of changes and ensure you can roll back if needed.
3. **Access Control**: Define who can view, modify, or deploy the template specs using RBAC.
4. **Deploy**: Use your preferred method (CLI, PowerShell, portal, etc.) to deploy the templates.

By using Azure Template Specs, you can create a robust library of ARM templates that streamline the deployment process and improve collaboration within your team.

**Scaling Up/Down requires machine downtime, Scaling In/Out does not**

![When to select Virtual machine scale sets](Screenshots/Day1/Compute6.PNG)

**As with Availability sets you can not add VMs to availability sets once they have been created so you need to consider this at the design phase or do machine migrations if they already exist**

### When to use Azure Batch
Azure batch enables large-scaling parallel and High Performing Compute (HPC) batch jobs

![When to use Azure Batch](Screenshots/Day1/Compute7.PNG)

### How Azure Batch Works
Think of the diagram in two parts:
- **Your Service** that uses the Azure platform.
- **Batch as the compute platform behind your service.** Batch uses Azure Storage to fetch applications or data needed to complete a task.

Considerations:
- Pools - dynamically allocated jobs, right size the pools.
- Nodes - use multiple nodes in the pool, right size the machines.
- Jobs - uniquely name the jobs, monitor the lo activity.

![How Azure Batch Works](Screenshots/Day1/Compute8.PNG)

### Azure App Services
#### When to use Azure App Services Web Apps
Azure app services is an HTTP-based service that lets you build and host apps

#### Considerations for App Service Web Apps

![Considering for App Service Web Apps](Screenshots/Day1/Compute10.PNG)

##### Azure Compute Unit (ACU)

An **Azure Compute Unit (ACU)** is a measure used to compare the compute (CPU) performance of different Azure virtual machine (VM) sizes. It provides a standardized way to understand the relative performance of various VM sizes across different Azure SKUs.

The ACU is based on the performance of a baseline VM size (Standard_A1), which is assigned a value of 100. Other VM sizes are then rated relative to this baseline, so you can easily see how much faster or slower they perform compared to the Standard_A1 VM.

### Determine the best storage account type
![Determine the best storage account type](Screenshots/Day1/DataStorage3.PNG)

**Once the BLOB has been uploaded you can not change its BLOB type**

**If you want to use NFS for Azure Files you must use Premium. NSB is available in both standard and premium**

### Considerations For Storage Accounts
It is important to plan your storage accounts
- **Location:** For performance reason locate the data close to users, One storage amount for each location.
- **Compliance:** Regulatory guidelines for keeping data in a specific location/Internal requirements for auditing or storing data.
- **Cost:** The setting for the account do influence the cost of the service in the account.
- **Replication:** Data storage could have different replication strategies
- **Administrative Overhead:** Each storage account requires some time and attention from an administrator to create and maintain

**It is possible that back ups are a cheaper option however with this we need to consider the Recovery time objective, Recover point Objective**

![Designs For Data Redundancy 2](Screenshots/Day1/DataStorage6.PNG)

### Determine The Storage Tier
Blob storage is an object store used for storing vast amounts of unstructured data.
- Premium
- Standard Hot
- Standard Cool
- Standard Cold
- Standard Archive

![Determine The Storage Tier](Screenshots/Day1/DataStorage7.PNG)

[Access tiers for blob data ðŸ“Ž](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/access-tiers-overview)

> *Data must remain in the archive tier for at least 180 days or be subject to an early deletion charge. For example, if a blob is moved to the archive tier and then deleted or moved to the hot tier after 45 days, you'll be charged an early deletion fee equivalent to 135 (180 minus 45) days of storing that blob in the archive tier.*

**User lifecycle rules to manage storage tiers**

### Immutable Storage Policies
Determine regulatory compliance, secure document retention and legal hold policies.

- Apply immutable storage policies at the container level
- Use **time-based retention policies** for business critical data
- Use **legal-hold policies** for sensitive inform to ensure tamper proof stat
- Policies apply only to new content
- Audit log are available

**Retention policies are only available on blob storage container**

![Immutable Storage Policies](Screenshots/Day1/DataStorage8.PNG)

#### WORM Storage

**WORM storage** stands for **Write Once, Read Many**. It's a type of data storage technology that allows data to be written to a storage medium once and then read multiple times without the possibility of modification or deletion. This ensures data integrity and immutability, making it ideal for regulatory compliance, data archiving, and other scenarios where it's crucial to prevent unauthorized changes.

#### Standard Retention Policies vs. Preservation Retention Policies

**Standard Retention Policies**:
- Define how long data should be kept before it is deleted or archived.
- Help organizations comply with legal and regulatory requirements.
- Ensure data is retained only as long as necessary, reducing storage costs and risks.

**Preservation Retention Policies**:
- Lock retention settings to prevent changes, ensuring data is retained for the required period.
- Protect against unauthorized alterations or deletions, often for regulatory compliance.
- Can be extended but not shortened once applied.

#### Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)
A data storage technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into one or more logical units to improve performance, redundancy, or both. This configuration allows for better data protection and increased read/write speeds, depending on the RAID level used.

| **RAID Type** | **Definition** | **Key Features** | **Use Cases** |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **RAID 0**    | Striped set without parity or mirroring. Data is split evenly across two or more disks. | - No data redundancy<br>- Improved performance<br>- Full storage capacity use | High-performance applications like video editing where data loss is acceptable. |
| **RAID 1**    | Mirroring. Data is duplicated on two or more disks. | - Data redundancy<br>- Fault tolerance<br>- Half storage capacity use | Critical data storage where data loss is unacceptable, such as financial records. |
| **RAID 5**    | Striped set with distributed parity. Data and parity (error-checking data) are distributed across three or more disks. | - Data redundancy<br>- Good performance<br>- Efficient storage capacity use | General purpose, file servers, and transactional applications. |
| **RAID 6**    | Similar to RAID 5 but with additional parity block. Data and parity are distributed across four or more disks. | - Double data redundancy<br>- Fault tolerance<br>- Efficient storage capacity use | Environments with high availability requirements, such as data centers. |
| **RAID 10 (1+0)** | Combines RAID 1 and RAID 0. Data is mirrored and then striped. | - High performance<br>- High data redundancy<br>- Less efficient storage use | High-performance and high-reliability applications, such as databases. |
| **RAID 50 (5+0)** | Combines RAID 5 and RAID 0. Multiple RAID 5 arrays striped together. | - Improved performance<br>- Data redundancy<br>- Efficient use of storage | High-load databases, large-scale transactional environments. |
| **RAID 60 (6+0)** | Combines RAID 6 and RAID 0. Multiple RAID 6 arrays striped together. | - Double data redundancy<br>- Improved performance<br>- Efficient storage use | Enterprise environments requiring high fault tolerance and performance. |

### Considerations for storage security
Use a layered model to secure and control access
- Grant limited access to Azure Storage resources
- Enable firewall rules to limit access to access - IP addresses or subnets
- Use private endpoints and private links for clients
- Use virtual network service endpoints to provide direct connection
- Use customer managed encryption keys

**If your question mentions needing 4 replicas you need to go Hyperscale**

### Select a Database Failover Strategy
Consider datacentre and regional failover
- In the same region - use AlwaysOn availability groups with failover to secondary replicas
- Across regions - Use geo-replication and failover groups

### When to use Azure Cosmos DB
A fully managed NoSQL database service for modern app development. It has single-digit millisecond response times and guaranteed speed at any scale.
- Web and mobile application that store and query user generated content like Tweets or blog posts
- Retail and marketing industry that store catalog data and event sourcing in order procuring pipelines
- Gaming that requires single-millisecond latencies for reads and writes and can handle massive spikes in request rates during new game launches or feature updates
- IoT use cases can load data into Azure Cosmos DB for adhoc querying. New data and changes to existing data can be read on change feed. The all data or just changes to the data in Azure Cosmos DB can be used as reference data as part of real-time analytics.

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strong Consistency**| Ensures that reads always return the most recent write for a given piece of data.                                                                                            | Applications that require strong data consistency and can tolerate higher latency and lower availability.                                                          | Higher write latencies and reduced availability during failures due to data replication across regions.                                                                           |
| **Bounded Staleness** | Provides a guarantee on the maximum staleness of the data, meaning reads can lag behind writes by a bounded amount of time.                                                  | Applications that can tolerate some staleness but need a predictable upper bound on data freshness.                                                                | Better performance and availability compared to strong consistency, with a predictable staleness window.                                                                          |
| **Session Consistency**| Ensures consistency within a single session, meaning reads within a session will see the latest writes.                                                                     | Applications that require consistency within a user session but can tolerate some staleness between sessions.                                                      | Improved performance and availability compared to bounded staleness, with consistency maintained within sessions.                                                                 |
| **Consistent Prefix** | Ensures that reads will always see a prefix of the writes, meaning the data is eventually consistent.                                                                        | Applications that can tolerate some level of inconsistency but need to ensure that data is eventually consistent.                                                  | Better performance and availability compared to session consistency, with eventual consistency guaranteed.                                                                        |
| **Eventual Consistency**| Provides the weakest consistency guarantee, meaning reads might return outdated data but will eventually become consistent.                                                | Applications that require high availability and can tolerate significant data staleness.                                                                           | Highest performance and availability, with the least stringent consistency requirements.                                                                                           |
