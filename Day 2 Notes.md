## Data Integration
### Learning Objectives
![Data Integration - Learning Objectives](Screenshots/Day2/DataIntegration1.PNG)

### Data-driven Workflows
Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based ETL (Extract Transform Load) and data ingestion service that can help you create and schedule data-driven workflows (called pipelines) that can ingest data from disparate data stores

You can use Azure Data Factory to:
1. Orchestrate data movement
2. Transform data at scale

![Data-driven Workflows](Screenshots/Day2/DataIntegration2.PNG)

### Azure Data Lake
Azure Data Lake Storage is a comprehensive, scalable and cost-effective data lake solution for big data analytics built into Azure

Use Azure Data Lake when you need:
- A data repository on the cloud for managing large volumes of data
- To manage a diverse collection of data types such as JSON files, CSV, Log files, or other diverse formats
- Real-time data ingestion and storage
- Unlike storage account containers, data lake container support Access Control Lists (ACL)

![Azure Data Lake](Screenshots/Day2/DataIntegration3.PNG)

#### Access Control List (ACL)

An **Access Control List (ACL)** is a list of rules that specify which users or system processes are granted access to objects, and what operations are allowed on those objects. An ACL typically includes a set of permissions attached to an object like a file, directory, or network resource, defining who can read, write, or execute that object.

##### Example

Consider a file named `document.txt`. The ACL for this file might look like this:

| User/Process | Permission |
|--------------|------------|
| Alice        | Read, Write|
| Bob          | Read       |
| System       | Execute    |

In this example:
- **Alice** has read and write permissions for `document.txt`.
- **Bob** has read permission for `document.txt`.
- **System** has execute permission for `document.txt`.

These permissions ensure that only authorized users and processes can perform specific actions on the file.

### How Hybrid Works

![How Hybrid Works](Screenshots/Day2/AA03.PNG)

#### What is a Domain Controller (DC)?

In it's rawest form it is:
- A Database
- A important folder called (SYSVOL)

It is responsible for the 5 A's:
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Accounting
- Auditing
- Administration

Strictly speaking user@domain.com is a UPN (User Principal Name) Although they look like email addresses they can only be considered as one if if linked to exchange (or another mail service provider)

##### Some Acronyms and buzz words that can come up
- **UPN:** User Principal Name - e.g. user@domain.com - *Note this looks like an email address but can only truly can be considered so if it is linked to exchange or another mail service provider*
- **SIP:** Session initiation protocol - A signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions
- **DNS** Domain Name System - A server that translates domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1), making it possible for devices to find and communicate with each other, both on the internet and within private networks.
- **DMZ** Demilitarized Zone: a secure network segment that acts as a buffer between a private internal network and the untrusted external network (like the internet). It hosts public-facing services while keeping the internal network protected.
- **Win32 apps:** An application that is designed to run on the Windows operating system using the Win32 API.

In a on-prem only domain you can have internal top level domains (TLD) *.local, .intranet etc...* These domains are not globally routable (if you were yo use a .local name outside of the on-premise ecosystem it would not resolve back to your intend address). In Entra we must use globally routable domains (.com, .edu, .co.uk, .org etc...)

In traditional on-prem only setups we would have a DNS server on the DC which would be used to resolve internal domain addresses internal and then another DNS server in the DMZ to resolve external names.

When shifting to a hybrid cloud model every effort to eliminate local domains should be made. We then end up in a state where the Internal DNS can route private traffic and the DMS DNS server Routing public traffic using the same routable names. This is known as Split Brain/Horizon DNS.

![EntraID Connect](Screenshots/Day2/AA04.PNG)

In Active Directory (AD) the authentication services are:
- Kerberos
- NTLM (NT LAN Manager)

In Entra we have different protocols for authentication:
- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
- OAuth
- OIDC (OpenID Connect)
- WS-Fed (Web Services Federation)

The reason we have so many different protocols in Entra is because of the way cloud distributes the data and services.

### When to use Conditional Access
Conditional Access is a Microsoft Entra tool that allows (or denies) access to resources
- Use to enable MFA
- Require managed devices
- Access only approved client applications
- Exclude countries from which you never expect a sign in
- Respond to potentially compromised accounts
- Completely block access
- Block legacy authentication protocols
- Test using the report-only mode

![When to use Conditional Access](Screenshots/Day2/AA09.PNG)

### When To Use Identity Protection
Identity protection is a Microsoft Entra tool that automates the detection and remediation of identity-based risks.
- Configure the policies and actively review the results
- Set the sing-in risk policy to medium and above and allow self-remediation options
- Set the user risk policy threshold to High
- Allow for excluding users - emergency access or break-glass administrator accounts
- Send data to Conditional Access or other security information (SIEM) tool

There are 3 levels of User Risks (think of it like a pain threshold, what can be tolerated)
- High
- Medium
- Low

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)

![Privileged Access Management (PAM)](Screenshots/Day2/AA11.PNG)

- JIT - Just In Tim
- JEA - Just Enough Access
- JLE - Jut Long Enough

### Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
Same as PAM but considers The task being carried out instead of what Action is needed

### PAM vs PIM
**Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** and **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** are both crucial for managing and securing access, but they serve different purposes. 

| **Feature**                | **PIM (Privileged Identity Management)** | **PAM (Privileged Access Management)** |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                  | Managing user privileges                | Monitoring and controlling access      |
| **Primary Goal**           | Control who has access to resources     | How access is granted and used         |
| **Authentication**         | Ensures users have the right privileges | Monitors and audits access usage       |
| **Authorization**          | Determines access based on roles/attributes | Controls and logs access events         |
| **Use Case**               | Prevent unauthorized access             | Prevent misuse of access               |
| **Example**                | Granting admin rights to specific users | Tracking admin activities              |

#### Key Differences:
- **PIM** focuses on **what access a user is granted** and **manages user identities** with elevated privileges.
- **PAM** focuses on **how access is controlled and monitored** whenever a user requests access to a resource.

### When to Use Access Review
Access reviews is a Entra tool to review user access and ensure they should have continued access to resources.

- Determine the purpose of the access review
- Engage the right stakeholders
- Create an access review plan
- Determine who will conduct the reviews
- Decide who can sel-asses access
- Determine what resource types will be reviewed
- Start small - pilot your plan - keep people informed

### Design Managed Identities
Managed identities provide an identity for application authentication.

![Design Managed Identities](Screenshots/Day2/AA13.PNG)

- The source is an Azure resource
- The target supports Microsoft Entra ID authentication and Azure RBAC
- No credential rotation or certificate management

### Select Managed Identities

![Select Application Service Principal](Screenshots/Day2/AA15.PNG)

### Design For Key Vault

**Azure Key vault is region specific**

![Azure Key vault is region specific](Screenshots/Day2/AA16.PNG)

Tiers:
- Standard
- Premium

The main difference between **Azure Key Vault Standard** and **Azure Key Vault Premium** lies in the level of security and the type of key protection they offer:

| **Feature**                | **Standard**                          | **Premium**                          |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Key Protection**         | Software-protected keys               | Hardware Security Module (HSM)-protected keys |
| **Security Level**         | Software security                     | HSM security + Software security     |
| **FIPS 140-2 Validation**  | Not applicable                        | Level 3 validated                    |
| **Use Case**               | General key management                | High-security key management         |

### Key Differences:
- **Key Protection**: Standard tier uses software-protected keys, while Premium tier includes HSM-protected keys for enhanced security.
- **Security Level**: Premium tier offers an additional layer of security with HSM protection on top of the software security provided by Azure.
- **FIPS 140-2 Validation**: Premium tier keys are FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated, ensuring compliance with stringent security standards.
